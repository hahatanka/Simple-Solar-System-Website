          <ol>
            <li>It's warped.
                The Milky Way is a disk that measures about 120,000 light years across, with a central bulge that has a diameter of about 12,000 light years.
                 The disk is not perfectly flat though, it is warped due to our neighboring galaxies Large and Small Magellanic clouds. 
                These two galaxies have been pulling on the matter in our galaxy like a game of tug-of-war.
            </li>
            <li>It has over 200 billion stars.
                The Milky Way is only a medium sized galaxy with an estimated 200 billion stars. 
                The largest galaxy we know of is called IC 1101 and has over 100 trillion stars.
            </li>
            <li>
                There is a black hole at the center.Like most larger galaxies, the Milky Way has a 
                supermassive black hole at its center called Sagittarius A*. 
                This black hole has an estimated diameter of 14 million miles, which does not include the disk of mass being drawn into it.
            </li>
            <li>
                It's on the move.Everything in space, including the Milky Way, is moving. The Earth moves around the Sun,
                the Sun moves in the Milky Way, and the Milky Way cruises through space.
            </li>
            <li>
                It was made from other galaxies. In order for the Milky Way to achieve its current size and shape it has consumed other galaxies throughout its history. 
            Our galaxy is currently consuming the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy by adding the smaller galaxyâ€™s stars to its own spiral.
